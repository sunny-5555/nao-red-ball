Student project at Esslingen University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule Esslingen)

## GDC
The IT Project Center is a part of the university. This center provides courses for (Gymnasium) school students.
The courses are designed to awaken interest for the IT world. The GDC is a part of this project which
is especially addressed for young girls. The courses are only for girls in order to encourage girls to choose a career path
in the IT field.

## Project Description
A course for the Girls' Digital Camps (GDC) is designed in this student project. The course gives an introduction to the
robotics world with the NAO robot. The school students will learn what kind of applications are running on the robot and
how you can easily build  application for the robot with the tool Choregraphe which is provided by Softbank Robotics. A 
demonstration, which has been implemented as a part of this project, will be presented to the school students. The 
application for the demonstration enables the robot to pick up or kick the red ball after it is tracked.
